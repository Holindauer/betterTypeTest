# betterTypeTest

This program is a simple improvement on standard typing tests. occasionally I'll become curious about how many words per minute I can type and seek out a typing test. However, in the wild, people do not copy text from a screen as they are writing, as is the case with many typing tests. 

This program is a typing test that counts the number of actual words that are typed in a time period.
